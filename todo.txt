- Add javascript to highlight groups/row/col on hover
- Add button to pull random sudoku from database
- Add server to pull random sudoku from websudoku

Strategies:

1 For a given group, see where the 1s, 2s, etc. are possible; fill them in if
  there's only one valid position
2 Repeat 1, but for a given row
3 Repeat 1, but for a given column
4 Use methods of the form val_in_row(5,2), and then when you get to this method,
  turn on a flag that allows this to not just use filled in valids
