# Tasks #

- Add javascript to highlight groups/row/col on hover
- Add button to pull random sudoku from database
- Add server to pull random sudoku from websudoku

# Things to Implement #

- Need new system for restrictions. 
  + Restrictions: cell I cannot be values V1, V2, ..., Vn.
  + Clusters: for row/col/box I, value V can only be in positions P1, P2, ...,
  Pn.
  
- Don't have max iterations for solve loop, just stop if every strategy has been
  tried and failed.
  
- Refactor to store a sequence of steps, and then animate the steps; avoid all
  the callback bs.
  
- Display animation effects of the stuff that's going on: ie, when looking at a
  box, then light up that box?
  
- Completely restructure Smart Grid Scan so that it only adds to already created
  restrictions, exhaustion search should always be the one to create the
  restrictions in the first place.

- Add ThinkInsideTheRow and ThinkInsideTheCol

- Add variables for all JQuery selections in domutil.

## Functions ##

- Give weights to the strategies based on how successful they've been so far,
  and then use those weights to determine which strategy to do next.

## Strategies ##

These are listed roughly in order of when they would be used. Strategies listed
first will be tried initially, and then strategies further down will be tried
when higher ones stop providing results. This is only roughly true,
though. Ideally I would like to have functions which represent heuristics for
"is this strategy likely to help?", and so those would be consulted before
deciding a stratgey (though the heuristics would be tried in this order, so if
strategies A and B are both likely to help, whichever is first on this list
would be tried first).

1. GridScan

   Consider each value that occurs 5 or more times, in order of currently most
   present on the grid to least present. For each value v, consider the boxes
   where v has not yet been filled in. For each box b, see if there is only one
   possible location p for v based on the other locations of v, and fill in v at
   p if there is only one such location.
   
2. ThinkInsideTheBox

   For each box b and for each value v which has not yet been filled in within
   b, see where v could possibly be placed within b (consulting the values in
   corresponding rows/cols and any cant/must arrays filled in within b); if v
   can only be placed in one position in b, then fill it in.
   
3. SmartGridScan

   Consider each value, in order of currently most present on the grid to least
   present. For each value v, consider each box b where v has not yet been
   filled in. Let p be the set of positions where v can be placed within b. If p
   is a single position, then fill in v at this position. If all the positions
   in p are in a single row or col, then call add_cant(c, v) for all cells c in
   the row/col outside of b.

4. ThinkOutsideTheBox

   For each box b and for each value v which has not yet been filled in wihtin
   b, see where v could possibly be placed within b (consulting the values in
   corresponding rows/cols, cant/must arrays of cells within b, and cant/must
   arrays of cells outside of b). Let p be the set of possible positions for v
   within b. If p is entirely within one row or col, then call add_cant(c,v) for
   each cell c within that row or col outside of b.

5. ExhaustionSearch (old CellByCell)

   Look through each cell. For each cell (only consider cells which have at
   least 4 total numbers in their row/col/group), see what values it can't be
   based on the values in its row/col/group; fill in a value if only one value
   is possible.
   
6. DesperationSearch (old CellByCell w/ desperate flag)

   Look through each cell. For each cell (consider all cells), see what values
   it can't be based on the values in its row/col/group. Fill in a value if only
   one value is possible. If 2-4 values are possible, store these values in a
   list of values representing the cell's possible values; if 5-9 values are
   possible, store the values that the cell cannot be in a list.
